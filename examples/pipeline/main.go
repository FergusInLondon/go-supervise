/*
This example demonstrates a Supervisor that's configured to monitor a
pipeline composed of multiple go-routines.

The pipeline is composed of 5 go-routines that are chained via channels.
Two of those go-routines are configured to panic upon every third input.
When executed you can see that despite these panics the functionality
looks interrupted.

	$ ./examples/bin/pipeline
	[Example] Dispatching counter 0
	Got new input 0 with ID 0
	Got new input 0 with ID 1
	Got new input 0 with ID 2
	Got new input 0 with ID 3
	panicked! 3
	Got new input 0 with ID 4
	panicked! 4
	[Example] Receiving counter 0
	[Example] Dispatching counter 1
	Got new input 1 with ID 0
	Got new input 1 with ID 1
	Got new input 1 with ID 2
	Got new input 1 with ID 3
